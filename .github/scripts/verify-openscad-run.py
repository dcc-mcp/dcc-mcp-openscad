"""Fail the real-hardware job when the OpenSCAD test did not actually execute.

`pytest -m openscad` exits 0 when its only test is skipped because
`OPENSCAD_TEST_EXECUTABLE` is unset, which would turn a missing host into a
green run. This guard reads the JUnit report and requires a real, non-skipped
pass.
